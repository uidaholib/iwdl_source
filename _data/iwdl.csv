C.; Ringe, Rudy R.",IWRRI,Lower Granite Dam,"46.63, -117.38",sturgeon; population growth; dam effects,"During the years 1972-75, we captured 876 sturgeon from the Snake River between Lower Granite and Hells Canyon dams. We marked or tagged the sturgeon so that we could assess their abundance, growth, distribution and movements. We recaptured 204 of the sturgeon, some up to eight times. Some of the large pools in the Snake River contained more than 200 sturgeon, according to our estimates. By expanding the population estimates we made for several pools in the river, we believe 8,000-12,000 sturgeon resided in the study area during the period 1973-1975. Small sturgeon (less than 3 feet) were the most abundant (86%) of the fish caught. Sturgeon 3-6 feet in length were least abundant (4%) and large fish (over 6 feet in length) comprised 10% of the fish we caught. There was some tendency for the small 2 to 3 foot sturgeon to move downstream, whereas the larger sturgeon did not move far from the original site of capture. Growth of sturgeon produced since dams were constructed in Hells Canyon was less than for sturgeon produced prior to damming of the river. Sturgeon are reproducing successfully in the middle section of the Snake River but the population may not thrive as in past years if the growth rate has indeed slowed and if critical habitat for the rearing of 3-6 foot sturgeon has been eliminated by dams in the lower Snake River",2012,9/1/1977,1977-09,application/pdf,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",197708,197708,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,University of Idaho,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,Text,University of Idaho,wbv,,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/idahowater/id/491,491,491.pdf,Volume21/197708.pdf

An approach to hydro-economic modeling using partial equilibrium optimization. Technical completion report 201402,"Tracy, John C.; Schmidt, Robert D.; Cuhaciyan, Jennifer",IWRRI,Boise Basin; Henrys Fork River,,model studies; hydroeconomic modeling; water supply; water demand; economic prediction; Henrys Fork River; Boise River watershed; Boise River watershed,"Conventional, economics-based water planning approaches often fail to adequately evaluate the economic efficacy of water projects by ignoring the dynamic relationship that exists between water supply and demand. More specifically, under the conventional approach to water management, which can be referred to as the supply management approach, the value of water is based upon the amount of compensation necessary to recover distribution costs (O&M, infrastructure, construction, etc.) with water demand forecasts assumed to be static and not affected by the cost of the supplied water. The demand management approach, on the other hand assumes that the costs associated with developing and delivering water supplies is invariant, and focuses on the value of water relative to the amount of water demand and controlling factors such as regulation, conservation, and availability of infrastructure. By ignoring how the demand for water changes as a result of changes in price and ignoring the change in cost associated with supplying greater amounts of water (referred to as the price/cost elasticity), both of these conventional approaches to water management fall short in their ability to adequately inform the development of effective water management strategies.   Hydro-economic analysis presents an alternative to the Demand Management and Supply Management approaches. This type of analysis utilizes economic concepts to understand how the supply and demand for water are affected by changes in the cost of developing and delivering water supplies and how the demand for these water supplies is based on the value that can be derived from the water by the water users (ie crop value). This approach moves away from a static view with a fixed and invariant water demand, to a view where the demand for water is related to the economic concept of â€œvalueâ€.  Use of an economic approach in water management and planning, particularly under conditions where water is a scarce resource, enhances the ability to develop management alternatives that are based on an efficient and equitable use of water, thereby reducing wasteful practices at both the individual and institutional scale. Given that the value of water changes with both quantity and type of use, understanding the economic costs and benefits associated with meeting the demand for water resources allows for a more effective comparison of water management alternatives. Hydro-economic analysis provides a framework for incorporating multiple-, and often competing-, objectives (ie water supply, flood control, hydropower, recreation, ecosystem requirements, etc) into a single analysis. By translatingthe value of each objective (or hydro-service) into its respective economic benefit, hydro-economic analysis allows for a direct evaluation of the economic efficacy of competing water management alternatives. Such an approach allows for a more holistic evaluation of water resource management actions, resulting in the development of more effective and sustainable water management strategies, and in turn reducing the likelihood of undesirable outcomes or unsustainable plan.",11/12/2014,10/15/2014,2014-10-15,pdf,"Microsoft Word 2010, 1.5 (Acrobat 6.x), 1,747,648 bytes",201402,201402,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,United States Bureau of Reclamation,text,University of Idaho,jh,,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/idahowater/id/545,545,545.pdf,Volume29/201402.pdf

P.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,Coeur d'Alene Basin,"47.52, -116.56",mine wastes; heavy metals; zinc; water quality; groundwater pollution,"The Smelterville Flats are located in the Coeur D'Alene River Valley in Northern Idaho. Mine wastes from zinc, silver and lead mines were discharged into the river and have been deposited in thicknesses up to seven feet over a large area of the Flats causing significant water quality degradation in the underlying aquifer. Water levels and water quality were monitored in ten pairs of piezometers (10 shallow and 10 deep) through two spring recharge events to study the effects of hydrology on water quality. Heavy metal concentrations measured in the shallow wells were consistently higher than those measured in the deep wells. Despite a significant difference in water quality between the shallow and deep sets of piezometers, dissolved constituents change congruently in the deep and shallow piezometers. Zinc concentrations in the shallow wells varied widely across the Flats. Zinc concentrations could be correlated with depth in the deep piezometers implying the existence of a downward concentration gradient away from the wastes above the aquifer. A linear relation between zinc and cadmium concentrations and to a lesser extent between zinc and lead concentrations supports the use of zinc as an indicator of contamination by the mine waste. While overall zinc concentration correlates positively with electrical conductivity collectively, well by well correlation is not consistent. Zinc concentration correlates negatively with pH in the deep wells but this correlation is not conclusive in the shallow wells. Variations in zinc concentrations are associated with antecedent precipitation and therefore recharge more than with water level rise. Therefore remediation efforts should focus on decreasing recharge. A conceptual model of heavy metal influx has been established consisting of three stratigraphic layers. Infiltrating ground water passes through the first layer and dissolves heavy metal ions. The heavy metal bearing water then moves downward through the second layer and mixes with horizontally migrating ground water of lower zinc concentration in the third layer. Some of this water eventually enters the South Fork of the Coeur D'Alene River.",2012,9/1/1990,1990-09,application/pdf,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",,CDA_Swope_1990,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,University of Idaho,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,Text,University of Idaho,wbv,,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/idahowater/id/157,157,157.pdf,Volume10/CDA_Swope_1990.pdf

Approximate solution to the Navier-Stokes equations for flow through a rectangularly packed bed of spheres,"Carson Jr., William McKinley",Boise Basin,,,fluid friction;,"Approximate solutions for the Navier -Stokes equations describing fluid fiow through a rectangular packing of spheres were obtained for Reynolds numbers of 0.1, 1, 7 and 35. Initial attempts to solve the Navier-Stokes equations with the inertia terms intact were unsuccessful. However, the methods used in these  solution attempts are given in detail. The results reported are based on an Oseen linearization of the full Navier-Stokes equations. The solutions were approximated by triple trigonometric series and the unknown coefficients evaluated using the Galerkin method for error distribution. Velocity components and pressure in the void space of the bed are given as explicit functions of the spacial coordinates. Friction factors for the packed bed and superficial velocity were evaluated from the velocity functions and are shown to agree with the experimental observations of previous investigators.

Previous surveys of (CDAL) sediment have suggested the majority of the metals are bound in an oxide phase, and if true, contaminated water may result if anoxic conditions occur in the water column. In contrast, data from this study indicate that the majority of the iron and trace elements are bound in a sulfidic phase. Examination of the sediment pore waters shows iron and trace element concentrations to be more than federal drinking water standards. Strongly reducing conditions and an abundant microbial community are also present, indicating that reactions that occur under reducing conditions are predominant in CDAL sediments. In particular, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are abundant in CDAL sediments. Isolates of native SRB have the ability to form sulfides from soluble metal. In such conditions, metal solubility is low. indicating that SRB may act to mitigate the effects of metal contamination in CDAL. Arsenic shows some different trends as compared with other trace elements. Arsenic solubility is highest in redox potential between the ferric to ferrous couple and the sulfate to sulfide couple. As (III) is not sorbed as well to sediment components, and hence formation of reduced forms of arsenic may encourage arsenic mobilization in anoxic sediments. Bacterial transformations of arsenic have recently been shown to occur in sediments. In this study, arsenic reducing organisms were found to be less abundant than SRB, but still numerous. Additions of soluble As (V) to sediment microcosms were reduced to As (III). This reduction was stimulated by organic acids, and was inhibited by a respiratory inhibitor of SRB. These results suggest that SRB can form metal sulfides, and also mobilize arsenic by creating a reduced mobile form.",2012,5/1/1998,1998-05,application/pdf,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",,CDA_Harrington_1998,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,University of Idaho,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,Text,University of Idaho,wbv,,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/idahowater/id/153,153,153.pdf,Volume10/CDA_Harrington_1998.pdf

The area also encompasses some of the foremost pollution problems in Idaho. The primary problems of environmental concern in this area today are the operating and abandoned tailings piles scattered throughout the district, the huge quantities of mine wastes accumulated along the streams, and the acid mine drainage from existing mines in the district. From previous studies, it is known that mine wastes containing iron sulfide (pyrite) in this area are capable of producing acid waters under oxidizing conditions. The redox status of ground water is an important factor in determining the degree of acid water formation and subsequent leaching of metals from mine tailings and ore bodies in this mining area. A new approach for measurement of the redox status of ground water involving analysis of water samples for concentrations of two arsenic species, As(V) and As(III), has been studied in this project. Based on thermodynamic equilibrium considerations, the apparent redox conditions can be evaluated from measured ratios of As(V)/As(III) in water. A simple solvent extraction method has been developed for the separation of arsenic species in mine waters using ammonium pyrrolidinedthiocarbamate (APDTC) as a chelatinq agent. The APDTC extraction method combined with neutron activation technique provides a very sensitive method for determining arsenic species in natural water systems. A detection limit of 0.1 ppb for the arsenic species in natural waters can be easily achieved using this method. This analytical method for arsenic speciation study is in the process of being published by ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY. Ground water samples were collected from a major lead-zinc mine (the Bunker Hill Mine) and from other locations of the Coeur d'Alene Mininq District to study the relationships between the arsenic species and other water quality data. The As(V)/As(III) ratios in ground waters collected from the Bunker Hill Mine were found to vary by more than two orders of magnitude indicating a wide range of redox conditions existing in the mine. The quality of ground water in the mine is strongly correlated with the ratio of As(V)/As(III) found in the system. Good quality waters were generally associated with low ratios (&lt;1) of As(V)/As(III). The ratio of the arsenic species and the concentrations of dissolved metals in the mine waters varied considerably with time. During the spring run-off, very high As(V)/As(III) ratios were observed in some poor quality waters presumably due to leaching of oxidized ores and mine wastes in certain locations of the upper levels of the mine. In the late summer, the ratio of As(V)/As(III) decreased as the system became more anaerobic and the water quality showed significant improvement correspondingly. The distribution of the arsenic species appears to be a useful chemical indicator to evaluate the potential of acid water formation and associated metal pollution problems in the ground water systems of this and other similar mining areas.",2012,10/1/1985,1985-10,application/pdf,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",198512,CDA_Wai_1985,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,University of Idaho,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,Text,University of Idaho,wbv,Water for Idaho,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/idahowater/id/102,102,98.pdf,Volume7/CDA_Wai_1985-0.pdf

The Project provides a mechanism for the coordination of various programs and activities designed to achieve these goals. The Coeur d'Alene Basin Restoration Project Framework is a roadmap for environmental protection and restoration of the basin. A task outlined in the framework, is the identification of attainable uses of stream segments in the basin. This task is the primary objective of this study. Recovery of beneficial uses of water bodies impacted by past land use activities is best assessed by in-stream water quality monitoring with results compared to specific water quality criteria. The beneficial uses of any given water body determine a set of water quality criteria necessary to support those beneficial uses. For this reason, beneficial use attainability assessments were conducted on a wide range of stream segments in the basin. Other objectives of the Coeur d'Alene Basin use attainability analysis are to: refine existing chemical water quality criteria and determine physical habitat and biological criteria necessary to support specific beneficial uses; and assess the status of beneficial uses of waters in the basin. Essentially, beneficial support status as determined by the current study provides a qualitative indication of the current support level of uses deemed attainable for a given waterbody; refined water quality criteria quantitatively identify the desired future condition necessary to achieve full support of beneficial uses. Future monitoring of beneficial use recovery will utilize quanitiative water quality criteria to gauge restoration success. In meeting the study objectives, this study reviewed beneficial use designations currently incorporated in the Idaho Water Quality Standards. A total of 21 streams have use designations in the Lake Coeur d'Alene basin, of which 11 were verified. This study identifies the need to revise the remaining use designations to accurately reflect the actual attainable and existing uses. An additional 155 streams in the basin were assigned beneficial use classifications based on a structured scientific approach set forth in Idaho's standard use attainability protocol. This study documents the attainable and existing beneficial uses for a wide range of water bodies in the Lake Coeur d'Alene basin based on background information provided by cooperating agencies and field verification results from the IDEO 1992 field surveys. In addition, the status of beneficial uses (full support, partial support or non-support) in the basin is assessed. The information generated in the study provides the impetus for anticipated revisions and inclusions of use designations in the Idaho Water Quality Standards, which are necessary for protection and restoration of water quality in the basin.

Water quality data show heavy inflows of nutrients during late spring into Coeur d'Alene Lake from the St. Joe and Coeur d'Alene Rivers and Plummer Creek.  Although no water devoid of dissolved oxygen have been measured, 2-4  mg/1 have been measured in the southern portion of the lake.  Phytoplankton productivity measurements and bottom organism identification and enumeration have shown that the lake functions at several trophic levels, meso-eutrophic to eutrophic in the southern portion, mesotrophic in the immediate area of the Coeur d'Alene River and ogliotrophic in the northern portions.  High metal concentrations (1000-7000 mg/kg Zn) in the bottom sediment of the middle and northern portions of the lake did not appear to substantially affect distribution of benthic chironomids or ogliochaetes.  Lake sediment cores taken across the delta region of the Coeur d'Alene River penetrated through the region of high metallic concentration and allowed an average sediment deposition rate to be calculated.  Algal toxicity tests showed the amount of Zn normally present in the Coeur d'Alene River and Spokane River to be inhibitory to the algal test organism Selanastrum capricornutum.  The water quality of the Spokane River was shown to be of good to excellent quality in all parameters tested except for high metallic content, especially Zn.  Activation and atomic absorption analysis of metallic content in the tissues of the organisms populating the Spokane River indicated that the algae were the prime concetrators of Zn, Cd, Pb, Hg, Fe, and Mn.  Algae and detritus consumers such as the larvae of caddisfly Hydropsyche and the nymphs of the mayfly Baetis reflected high metallic concentrations.  Most higher aquatic plants showed relatively lower concentrations.  Analysis of fish tissues showed considerably less concentration of metals than the aquatic plants, insects or algae.  However, Zn was measured at concentrations of 80-200 mg/kg in liver tissues of several species of fishes.  Fillet tissues generally contained less than one quarter of these amounts.  The fish, when collected, did not appear under stress leading the investigators to believe that most of the metals--although present in relatively high concentration in the tissues of the orgamisms tested--must be in a relatively innocuous state.",2012,6/30/1973,1973-06-30,application/pdf,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",197315,CDA_Funk_1973,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,University of Idaho,"Co-investigators: Dunigan, Jr., Paul F.

In certain instances these blooms produce a toxin which can be lethal to fish, aquatic invertebrates, mammals and humans. Black Lake in northern Idaho has experienced massive late summer and fall growths of a toxic algae, Nostoc commune. At times, demonstrated fatal toxicity to cattle and small mammals has resulted in three of the last four years. Since little is known of the exact environmental conditions required to cause toxicity, environmental and phytoplankton parameters were monitored throughout the lake durinq summer and fall, 1984. Although conditions seemed favorable, and other blooms were intermittent through the summer-fall 1984, Nostoc did not develop to bloom proportions and toxicity did not occur. Algal assay results showed that algal growth potential ranged in the very productive range of -1 9.60 to 12.16 mg dry weight 1 /14 days for the late summer-early fall period. The limiting nutrient switched from phosphorus to nitrogen during the fall months, also indicating the potential for a Nostoc bloom. All indicators showed that Black Lake was highly productive in 1984 despite the absence of a toxic Nostoc bloom. Water transparency ranqed from 0.8 to 3.4 m, averaging 1.2 m from June to October. pH values went as high as 8.2, with the total absence of CO2 in some of the littoral areas. Dissolved oxygen values were at super saturated levels throughout most of the sampling reqime. Diatoms (Fragilaria sp., Melosira sp., and Asterionella sp.) dominated the phytoplankton composition with Nostoc only showing up in early August. Chlorophyll 11 a11 values correlated with phytoplankton trends, with highs of 15 to 31 mgl-1, and lows of 0 to 5 mgl-1. The fact that Black Lake is clearly eutrophic, and that the potential for a blue-green bloom was present but did not materialize, may possibly be explained by two factors ... climatoloqical trends and stratification pattern.

Characterization of deoximorphic features in mine waste-contaminated wetlands soils,"Hickey, P.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,Coeur d'Alene River,"47.51, -116.15",heavy metals; groundwater contamination; speciation; mineralogy,"Metal contamination from Northern Idaho mining operations has impacted wetlands along the Coeur d'Alene River floodplains resulting in a potentially hazardous environment for humans and animals. Contamination in these areas is often reported as total contaminant concentration per mass of soil, and assumes that the contaminants are homogenously distributed throughout the soil. However, pedogenesis causes distinct secondary mineral redistribution within soil profiles, and leads to selective partitioning of contaminants within the profile at macro (em) to sub-micron scales. This study examined the variability of redoximorphic features within a wetland, and contaminant enrichment in redoximorphic features relative to landscape position and water table height. Six distinct categories of Fe and Fe/Mn-rich cemented redoximorphic features were identified. The Fe and Fe/Mn-cemented redox features were found to have Cd and Pb concentrations up to four and six times greater in magnitude than soil averages. Iron and Fe/Mn-cemented redox features also had elevated levels of As and Zn. The Fe/Mn-cemented aggregates had the highest Mn concentrations (approximately 3.4ï¿½/o), were most common in the 1-2 mm size fraction, and contained the highest concentration of Pb (approximately 2.6ï¿½/o). Iron-cemented root channel linings and Fe-cemented aggregates had comparable concentrations of As, Cd, Mn, Pb, and S. Coarse sand aggregates and Fe/Mn-cemented aggregates had similar concentrations of Cd, Mn, P, and Zn. Iron-cemented aggregates and cemented root channel linings had physical similarities, while coarse sand aggregates and Fe/Mn-cemented aggregates also appeared similar. The Fe and Fe/Mn-cemented redox features were found primarily in the top 15 em of soil and decreased with soil depth. Results from this study show that pedogenesis in Coeur d'Alene wetland soils results in distinct redoximorphic features and non-homogeneous metal concentrations. Among these features are Fe and Mn - cemented aggregates that range in size from 1 to 2 mm in diameter. These aggregates have unique mineralogy and concentrate metals within the soils. Understanding contaminant partitioning and speciation in soils will allow for improved management and risk assessment of the contaminated soils.",2012,4/1/2006,2006-04,application/pdf,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",,CDA_Hickey_2006,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,University of Idaho,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,Text,University of Idaho,wbv,,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/idahowater/id/175,175,175.pdf,Volume10/CDA_Hickey_2006.pdf

"Characterization of heavy metal contamination in two lateral lakes of the Lower Coeur d'Alene River Valley, Northern Idaho","Hoffman, Mark",Coeur d'Alene Basin,Coeur d'Alene River; Thompson Lake; Medicine Lake,"47.49, -116.72",heavy metals; mine wastes; sediment,"The lower Coeur d'Alene River valley in Northern Idaho has received heavy metal contamination from over a century of upstream mining activity. Medicine and Thompson Lakes are two of the 11 lateral lakes of the Coeur d'Alene River that lie on the flood plain. In their bottom sediments is preserved a stratigraphic record of upstream mining operations. A freeze box, designed by a Quaternary geologist in Finland, was used to sample the lake bottom sediments. This method preserves the vertical stratigraphy. As little as 10 cm and up to 52 cm of undisturbed tailing sediments with """"varve-like"""" features was recovered. Geochemical analyses of these sediments show maximum concentrations of 49 ppm Ag, 427 ppm As, 68 ppm Cd, 341 ppm Cu, 10.9% Fe, 1.8 ppm Hg, 1.1% Mn, 1.8% Pb, 48 ppm Sb and 1.1% Zn. 137Cs was used to establish the depositional chronology of the lake bottom sediments. Fourteen centimeters of sediment were deposited between 1951 and 1964, and 10-12 cm from 1964 to 1992. Particle size distribution and analysis found that the fractions containing the highest Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations are the least abundant in the samples. The most abundant size fraction has some of the lowest heavy metal concentrations.

Characterization of the upper aquifer beneath Smelterville Flats with implications for mitigation of groundwater contamination,"Kunkel, Douglas",Coeur d'Alene Basin,Coeur d'Alene Basin,"47.52, -116.56",mine wastes; water quality; groundwater pollution,"In the early part of this century, the Smelterville Flats area near Kellogg, Idaho received mining, milling, and metallurgical wastes. Mine wastes were deposited on the flood plain or in the channel of the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River. In the early 1900s, a series of dams were built across the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River at the western end of Smelterville Flats in an attempt to control the downstream transport of mine wastes. Mine wastes and other sediments were deposited behind this dam. The site, known as Smelterville Flats, is the largest uncontrolled deposit of mining wastes that remains in the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River Valley. Water levels and water quality samples were collected from existing monitoring wells within the Smelterville Flats study area. A more intensive study was conducted on a small sub-area of the Smelterville Flats study area known as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) sub-area. Ten sets of piezometers were installed to monitor water quality and water levels in the upper aquifer beneath Smelterville Flats in the BLM sub-area. A pumping well and observation wells were installed in the BLM sub-area in order to conduct a pumping test in the upper aquifer to determine aquifer coefficients. Ground water level gradients in the study area indicate that the ground water flow direction is from east to west, following the general gradient of the valley of the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River. Water levels also indicate that the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River is a losing stream in the east end of the study area and a gaining stream in the west end of the study area. Shallower monitoring wells in the upper aquifer within the BLM sub-area consistently had higher concentration of ions associated with mining wastes than deeper monitoring wells installed in the same aquifer at the same location. Oxidation of the mine wastes may occur in the unsaturated zone in the presence of oxygen, or in the presence of oxygen and water if the film of water is thin enough to allow the diffusion of oxygen to the reaction sites. The thin layer of water surrounding the wastes may become a concentrated solution of soluble reaction products. Infiltration of precipitation, and rises in ground water levels flush and transport the soluble reaction products from the reaction sites on the wastes into the shallow ground water system. The oxidation products are removed from the reaction sites, thereby producing fresh reaction sites for the next influx of oxygen. The reaction products may then be transported by the ground water flow system, which ultimately discharges to the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River at the western end of Smelterville Flats. Based on the data collected, potential mitigative measures were evaluated and analyzed in order to minimize the adverse long-term effects of mine waste on the ground water and surface water systems. Potential mitigative measures that are evaluated include treatment of the shallow aquifer water, elimination or reduction of ground water flow through the shallow aquifer, removal of the major sources of metal ions, and no action. The continuation of research to identify or develop a mechanism to extract marketable metals from the wastes on Smelterville Flats appears to constitute the most appropriate course of action.",2012,11/1/1993,1993-11,application/pdf,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",,CDA_Kunkel_1993,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,University of Idaho,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,Text,University of Idaho,wbv,,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/idahowater/id/160,160,160.pdf,Volume10/CDA_Kunkel_1993.pdf

Chemical speciation of arsenic and antimony in natural water systems and its applications to environmental problems,"Mok, Wai Man",Coeur d'Alene Basin,Coeur d'Alene River,"47.51, -116.15",heavy metals; mine wastes; sediment; speciation,"A method for the speciation of trivalent and pentavalent states of inorganic arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb) in natural waters has been developed. The proposed method first extracts the trivalent As(III) and Sb(III) as pyrrolidinecarbodithioate (PCDT) complexes into chloroform, followed by a nitric acid back-extraction to recover the elements. Arsenic and Sb in the acid solution are determined by neutron activation analysis (NAA). The pentavalent species, As(V) and Sb(V), are reduced to the trivalent state using potassium iodide and sodium thiosulfate and then are extracted with PCDT for NAA. The two-step preconcentration procedure provides a large enrichment factor, eliminates the interfering matrix species, and extends the useful working range of NAA for As and Sb. The extraction method has also been applied to the determination of low levels of As and Sb in biological samples by NAA. The speciation method has been used to evaluate the distribution of As(III) and As(V) and its relation to other water quality parameters in the groundwater system of a major lead-zinc mine in the Coeur d'Alene Mining District of northern Idaho. It is known that mine wastes containing pyrite (FeS2) are capable of producing acid waters under oxidizing conditions, and the redox status of groundwater is an important factor in determining the degree of acid water formation and subsequent leaching of metals from mine tailings and ore bodies in this mining area. The results obtained from this study show that the relative concentrations of the arsenic redox pair are correlated with the quality of the mine waters studied and the ratio of As(V)/As(III) has the potential to be a redox indicator for groundwater systems. The river sediments of the South Fork and the Main Stem of the Coeur d'Alene River are contaminated with As, Sb, and other heavy metals from past mining activities. The distribution of As and Sb species in the river waters has been studied. Trivalent As(III) is the predominant form of arsenic in the South Fork and the Main Stem, whereas the unpolluted North Fork generally has a higher concentration of As(V). The major Sb species in the three branches of the river is Sb(V). Mobilization of sediment As and Sb during sediHent-water interactions has been investigated using laboratory leaching experiments. The releases of As and Sb are related to the free iron oxides and free manganese oxides of the sediments. The effects of the contaminated sediments on the water quality, with respect to As and Sb, of the creeks surrounding the Blackbird area in east-central Idaho have also been investigated. The pentavalent As(V) and Sb(V) are the major species observed in the creek waters. The field observations are consistent with the leaching experiments performed in the laboratory. The contaminated sediments are non-point sources of pollution which should be considered for water quality management planning of the mining areas studied.",2012,5/1/1988,1988-05,application/pdf,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",,CDA_Mok_1988,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,University of Idaho,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,Text,University of Idaho,wbv,,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/idahowater/id/152,152,152.pdf,Volume10/CDA_Mok_1988.pdf

"Comparison of macroinvertebrate samplers and the relationship of environmental factors to biomass and diversity variability in a small watershed. Research technical completion report, project no. A-049-IDA","Newlon, Thomas A.; Rabe, Fred W.",IWRRI,Horse Creek Drainage,"45.95, -115.33",macroinvertebrates; biomass; species diversity; natural streams,"Variability in macroinvertebrate biomass and diversity between streams in a relatively undisturbed watershed was determined by sampling at 19 stations in first through fourth order streams of the Horse Creek drainage, Idaho. Macroinvertebrate biomass and diversity values varied significantly (P&lt;.05) both between different stream orders, and between streams of the same order. Biomass and diversity variability was correlated with physical and chemical factors by stepwise regression analysis. A large percentage (&gt;85%) of the variance in both biomass and diversity was accounted for by changes in four to five physical and chemical factors, which included substrate size, gradient, suspended sediment water temperature, alkalinity, stream order and width. This indicates that predictive modeling of macroinvertebrate community structure is possible in a small, relatively undisturbed watershed. Basket, multiple-plate and Surber macroinvertebrate samplers were used to determine which sampler is most applicable for use in small relatively undisturbed streams. Comparisons were made on the basis of sample biomass) diversity and taxonomic composition. Basket samples had more biomass and higher diversity than multiple-plate samples throughout the watershed, probably because they provided a better imitation of the natural substrate. Basket sample diversities were similar to Surber sample diversities in first and second order streams, but were much lower in third and fourth order streams. Both basket and multiple-plate samplers were found to be adequate for stream survey work. The inconsistancies found with Surber samplers indicated that they were most applicable only when time and resources were at a minimum, or when sampling was designed only to determine which taxa were present at a given site.",2012,6/1/1977,1977-01,application/pdf,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",197715,197715,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,University of Idaho,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,Text,University of Idaho,wbv,Water for Idaho,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/idahowater/id/498,498,498.pdf,Volume21/197715.pdf
Comparison of runoff from a catchment snow pillow and a small forested watershed,"Molnau, Myron",,Crumerine Watershed; Moscow Valley,"46.8, -116.9",snowmelt; runoff volume; lysimeters;,A 12-by- 12-foot square pressure pillow was modified by the addition of drains to collect the snowmelt from the pillow. This meltwater was collected in tanks and monitored by stage recorders. The daily runoff amounts from the catchment pillow was compared with the mean daily runoff from a 1580-acre watershed and one of approximately 80 acres. The runoff from the pillow provided a good measure of the timing of runoff from the two watersheds. A time lag of one day was found for the small watershed and 2 to 3 days for the latter watershed.,2012,4/20/1971,1971-04-20,application/pdf,"300 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",197111,197111,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,University of Idaho,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,Text,University of Idaho,wbv,,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/idahowater/id/132,132,132.pdf,Volume8/197111.pdf
