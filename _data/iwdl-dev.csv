Some limnological aspects of Spring Valley Reservoir,"Duff, Douglas Willard",1965-05,,"46.78, -116.76",limnology; reservoirs,"The present investigation is an attempt to contribute to our inadequate knowledge of limnological interrelationships in an artificial body of water. Spring  Valley Reservoir, a 56 acre artificial lake, was selected for study. Field work extended from May through November,  1964, but certain phases of the laboratory work were not completed until March, 1965.  Particular attention has been given to vertical and seasonal variations of zooplankton populations in reference to selected environmental factors such as temperature,  transparency, dissolved oxygen, free carbon dioxide, total and calcium hardness, alkalinity, nitrogen, and phosphorous. In addition, emphasis has been given to  the mean summer standing crop of zooplankton.  Although limnology has been recognized as a distinct branch of science for less than 70 years (Welch, 1952),  much has been done to provide an understanding of lake productivity and the numerous factors influencing productivity . Many investigations have been conducted in an  attempt to determine characteristics with which to classify the productivity of lakes. As a result, many physical,  chemical, and biological measures of productivity have evolved and are now used with varying degrees of success.  Some of these limnological methods have been included in the present investigation.",Palouse Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,196501,196501,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2007-12-08,"300 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",Jodi Haire,,37
"Relationship of farm size to ability to pay for irrigation water in the dry lake area of Canyon County, Idaho","Coffing, Arthur Lee",1965-05,Boise River,"43.71, -116.76",irrigation; Idaho; Canyon County,"The main objective of the study is to determine the ability of different sizes of farms to pay for irrigation water. This ability will be measured by the capability of the farm to produce high value crops at low costs.  Phrased in a different way, the objective of this study is to find the maximum that farms of various sizes can pay for irrigation water if, at the same time, all other factors of production are adequately rewarded. This, to some degree, will indicate the maximum value of water if irrigation is its highest use. This type of information can be of use to future studies which involve water rights or water values.  A secondary objective is to determine the economies of size of the various enterprises.

A solid-liquid phase precipitation metering device,"Read, John Carlton",1966-06,,,precipitation,"A need for a precipitation metering device capable of discriminating between solid and liquid phases of precipitation initiated this research project.  A literature search revealed no existing instrument capable of performing this function; however, references were found to certain schemes which, with modifications, could possibly be adapted as a solution to this problem.  An optical scheme was selected for further research because this type of system requires no mechanical motion, thus avoiding icing problems likely to be encountered in the operational environment, and because luminous radiation and electricity are energy forms which are easily transducible from one form to the other.  A photosensitive device was used to determine the relative light attenuant and reflective effects of the precipitation particle types.  With certain geometric restrictions it was found that the reflective properties of snow are of a sufficient degree of magnitude greater than those of rain to enable the development of a system sensitive to the presence of snow and not rain. Optical attenuant characteristics of the snow and rain particles were found to be similar in degree of magnitude of photosensitive device response.  A prototype system employing both reflective and attenuant effects of the particles was developed and shown to be capable of detection and identification of both precipitation phases.

"The economic value of water in different uses within agriculture. Research technical completion report, project A-017-IDA","Maher, Matthew Joseph",1967-08,,,water use; irrigation water,"This study was undertaken in order to determine the economic value of water in alternative uses within agriculture in Idaho. It is important to Idaho farmers and to the economy of Idaho in general to have such estimates available so that maximum economic gains may be derived from the available supply of irrigation water.  Three irrigation areas, Area I, Area II, and Area III, along the Snake River valley were studied. Costs of producing different crops in those areas were already available from previous studies. The author interviewed selected farmers in two of those areas to update available information and to determine the resource supply situations confronting operators.  The analytical tool applied to fulfill the objectives was linear programming. Three representative farms of different sizes were constructed for Area I and one each for Areas II and III. Three analytical models were formulated as steps in attaining the objectives. Changes were made from model to model in order to make the analysis more realistic or to investigate some particular facet of the problem.   The results of the study indicate that the value of water varies from area to area, water being most valuable in Area I and least valuable in Area III. Analysis of different sized farms in Area I indicates that farmers can afford to pay more for water on large farms than on smaller farms.

New development: the Geiger-Muller radioisotope snow gage,"Waldron III, Harvey Macy",1967-05,,,radioactive snow gages,"Since about 1947, the use of radioactive isotopes has been known to be adaptable to the measurement of water contained in snow packs. Early investigations of these measurement techniques were unsuccessful because the Geiger-Muller detector, the detector readily available at that time, is a device incapable of energy discrimination.  Energy discrimination is achievable by the use of scintillation detectors resulting in the present use of these devices as radiation snow gages. However, the scintillation systems have the disadvantages of high cost and complex maintenance as compared to Geiger-Muller systems.  Mechanical energy discrimination, using collimation techniques, makes possible use of the non-energy discriminant Geiger-Muller systems for snow gaging. This paper discusses such a system that has been developed and tested. Design emphasis is placed on energy discrimination and electronic dead-time correction methods. Laboratory and field test data are presented to show predictable performance characteristics. All evidence to date indicates that the Geiger-Muller snow gage may be preferable, considering the combined aspects of accuracy and costs, to either the scintillation snow gage or the pressure pillow.

Field studies of existing seepage measurement techniques including ponding tests, inflow-outflow techniques and seepage meters were made. A new seepage meter which will operate efficiently in large operating canals was developed. An accurate and reliable tensiometer system for monitoring changes in soil moisture pressure beneath operating canals was developed. Measured decreases in soil moisture and pressure beneath an operating canal during the irrigation season indicated decreasing seepage rates caused by natural sealing of a thin soil layer on the canal bottom. A fast response, inexpensive null point tensiometer was laboratory tested and a device for measuring the capillary pressure - saturation curve for soils in situ was investigated.

The author interviewed many of the farmers in the area in order to collect physical input and output information. This information was gathered for the years 1965, 66, & 67.   The analytical tools applied to fulfill the objectives were a synthetic budget approach in conjunction with a linear programming model. Such analysis depicted the structure of three sizes of typical farms in the area in contrast to three theoretical optimum farms.   The results of this study indicate that the farmers in the area are now relatively close to the theoretical optimum structure. Also, economies of size were found to the extent that the smaller farmers received approximately 50% less than the larger farmers for their return to management and water.

Studies on methods of soil moisture determination,"Hite, Howard Eugene",1968-04,,,soil water,"Though the need for instrumentation capable of determining soil moisture quickly and accurately has long been recognized, no dependable means suitable for automatic and remote soil moisture measurement has yet been developed. Presently, the only reliable method for measuring soil moisture is a time consuming process which requires human attention. Water is removed from a soil sample by heating, and the resultant weight loss is determined. Considerable work has been reported on a device which measures the electrical conductivity of a gypsum block imbedded in the soil. Water causes the electrical resistance of the block to decrease. These blocks are alleged to be unreliable under many field conditions. The work reported in this thesis was undertaken with the intent to develop a more reliable instrument for remote site operation. An extensive survey of the literature led to the selection of three fields of study: streaming potential, thermal conductivity and specific heat, and absorption of infrared radiation by moist soil.  Experimentation revealed that the factors controlling streaming potential were so diverse that isolation of soil moisture or moisture flow variables was not feasible in field applications.  An original thermal measuring device could be successfully and reliably used in certain ambient temperature ranges.  Certain wavelengths in the infrared spectrum are readily absorbed by moisture in the soil.

The four lakes were similar in having a simple species composition and low density of limnetic crustaceans. For all samples Fisher's coefficient of dispersion S2/X-bar was computed and used as a measure of horizontal dispersion. Mean total crustacean density and dispersion appeared to approximate taxa density and dispersions. Data for all comparisons were based on the density and horizontal dispersion of mean total crustaceans.   The meadow lakes had higher densities of limnetic crustaceans than the headwall lakes, 1966 and 1967. There was an indication that a positive linear relationship existed between total crustacean density and coefficient of dispersion when sampled by different methods in each of the four lakes.

Relationship between farm size and ability to pay for irrigation water. Idaho agricultural research progress report no. 112,"Coffing, Arthur; Lindeborg, Karl H.",1966,Snake River,"43.46, -116.6",farms; water supply; irrigation,"This study was conducted in the Dry Lake area at Nampa, Idaho, where 5 or 6 companies are pumping irrigation water from the Snake River to a plateau 500 to 600 feet above the river surface. Irrigation development costs of bringing the water to the headgates of the farms are not included in this phase of the study.   Data was secured for 8 farms by interviewing each farm operator and land owner. To make comparisons between farms and also between enterprises, the data were broken down into per acre variable costs, fixed costs, total returns, net income and the cost of producing a dollar's worth of output. The term &quot;cost per dollar of output&quot; is the ratio of costs to returns. This ratio makes it possible to compare high-valued crops with low-valued crops on a per acre basis. This is a very sensitive measurement. For ex-ample, one cent change in the ratio for potato enterprise means a change in net income of $3.25 per acre.   The budgeting method of estimating water values in irrigation was used in this study. Long-run planning cost curves were estimated from the budgets by using simple curve linear regression.

"Geology and hydrogeology of the Albion Basin, Cassia County, Idaho","Myers, David Arthur",1967-05,Snake River,"42.41, -113.57",geology; geohydrology; Cassia County,"Albion basin is an alluvium-filled basin in eastern Cassia County, Idaho, about 18 miles southeast of Burley.   The study area is in the Basin and Range province of the western United States. The eastern boundary of the basin is formed by the Malta Range, a rotated fault block which apparently is bounded by high-angle normal faults on the east and west. A line of hot springs marks the probable position of the fault on the west side of the Malta Range. East Hills bounds the basin on the north and the main mass of Albion Range forms the south and west boundaries.  The Malta Range and part of the East Hills are made up of a thick flow of quartz latite. The flow consists of three zones: lower and upper vitrophyre zones, and a central lithoidal zone. No mineralogical differences and no physical breaks were noted between the zones. Capping the Malta Ridge in the north is a body of Snake River basalt about one square mile in area. The Albion Rage is underlain by metamorphic rocks.   Marsh Creek is the principal stream in the basin, but the ground water is the main source of irrigation and domestic water. Wells range in depth from 11 feet to more than 700 feet and yields range from a few gallons per minute to 540 gallons per minute. Wells must be cased the entire depth of penetration. Several clay lenses in the alluvium create local artesian aquifers. The water, mostly of the calcium-bicarbonate type, is suitable for domestic and irrigation use:  the total dissolved solids content ranges from 202 ppm. to 2294 ppm; temperatures of the waters in the deep wells are generally 62 degrees to 74 degrees Fahrenheit, and in the shallow wells, 57 degrees Fahrenheit. Hot springs in Marsh Canyon are used only for irrigation, although the possibility exists that they could be developed for domestic heating or for recreation.  Quantitative data on water resources could not be obtained from the present study, but available data suggest that the basin is not yet fully developed.",Boise Basin,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,196704,196704,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2008-09-18,"300 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF; 2,880,954 bytes",Jodi Haire,,61

"Feasibility of artificial recharge of a small ground water basin by utilizing seasonal runoff from the intermittent streams, a preliminary study of artificial recharge of ground water in Moscow basin, Latah County, Idaho. Proceedings of the 6th annual Enginieering Geology & Soils Engineering Symposium","Jones, Robert W.; Ross, Sylvia H.; Williams, Roy E.",1968-04-18,,,recharge basins; intermittent streams; artificial recharge; Latah County,"The City of Moscow and the University of Idaho are the principal users of ground water in Moscow basin. Water is obtained from artesian aquifers in the basalt flows and interbedded sediments of the Columbia River Group.  From 1896 to the 1960s, all water was obtained from an artesian aquifer that is at a depth of about 250 feet. Water levels in the wells declined steadily over the years; the total decline at the city's pumping plant was about 100 feet by the 1960s.  The water in the aquifer is of poor quality because of high concentrations of iron.  Exploration for other ground water supplied led to the discovery of good quality water in productive aquifers at depths of 700 feet and 1300 feet.  The City and University shifted nearly all pumping to the deeper aquifers, and since heavy pumping ceased in the upper aquifer, water levels have been steadily rising.  Properties of the deeper aquifers are not yet known and the amount of water that they will yield over long periods of time is uncertain.  Strong possibility exists that the deeper aquifers will show a long-term decline of water levels, indicating depletion of the supply of ground water.  It is uncertain that projected future demands can be met by naturally-available ground water.  Import of surface water from outside the basin is costly due to distance, construction cost of pipeline, operation cost of high pumping lift.  Preliminary study indicates that artificial recharge of ground water by utilizing seasonal runoff from intermittent streams in and near Moscow basin is a feasible and cheaper alternative to long-distance importation of surface water.

The first approach was to estimate the economic value of water through cost function analysis. The value of water in this approach is a proportion of the cost of producing a dollar value of output. This approach does not yield the value of an incremental acre foot of water, but yields a weighted average of all the increments of water over the whole range of production.  The other approach of economic analysis was the application of linear programming in estimating the value of an incremental unit of water. Three irrigation areas along the Snake River were included in the study. Costs of producing different crops were computed and representative farms of the three areas were constructed. These farm operations were assumed to be typical of the areas, and under given resource allocation restrictions, the economic return to the input of water would indicate the value of an incremental unit of water in the production of agricultural products.",,,,"Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI; Coffing, A.

A survey of the literature led to the selection of four fields of study: streaming potential, thermal conductivity and specific heat, absorption of infrared radiation by moist soil, and some adaption of the principle of nuclear magnetic resonance.   Experimentation revealed that the factors controlling streaming potential were so diverse that isolation of soil moisture or moisture flow variables was not feasible in field applications. Extensive laboratory testing of an original thermal measuring device showed that this principle could be successfully and reliably used in certain ambient temperature ranges. The data also revealed that, when soil is partially frozen at 32 degrees F, information could be derived on the percentage of the soil water in the frozen state, provided the soil moisture content was known. Certain wavelengths in the infrared spectrum are readily absorbed by moisture in the soil. A prototype instrument which utilizes this phenomenon was fabricated. Certain problems in packaging the unit were encountered, but preliminary experimentation assured that this measuring technique shows promise and could be further developed.

Simulation of ground water flow in the lower Boise River Basin,"Petrich, Christian R.",2004-02,Boise River,"43.65, -116.44",groundwater flow; Boise River Watershed; Ada County; Canyon County; computer simulation,"The lower Boise River basin (Treasure Valley) aquifer system consists of a series of shallow,  relatively high-permeability aquifers and a deeper, regional flow system. A numerical model of regional ground water flow was developed to evaluate (1) the effects of large-scale increases in ground water withdrawals on regional ground water levels and (2) the potential effects of altered recharge rates (associated with conversion of agricultural to urban land use) on regional ground water levels.  The model was constructed using the three-dimensional, finite difference MODFLOW code (Harbaugh et al., 2000; McDonald and Harbaugh, 1988; McDonald and Harbaugh, 1996).  The model was calibrated under steady-state hydraulic conditions using the automated parameter estimation code PEST (Doherty, 1998; Doherty, 2000). Horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity parameters were calibrated to 200 averaged water level observations  and 6 actual and estimated vertical head differences.  The model calibrated with higher hydraulic conductivity values in the uppermost aquifer zones, corresponding with known areas of coarser-grained sediments. PEST-calibrated parameter values also indicated relatively high hydraulic conductivity values in areas of the  eastern and central portion of the valley associated with fluvial/deltaic deposition. Simulated fluxes between model layers in the base calibration indicated a relatively small amount of water moves vertically between model layers, especially in the lower layers. Based on simulation results, most recharge that occurred in shallow aquifer zones did not reach deeper  zones.  A 10% increase or decrease in recharge led to minimal changes in water levels or parameter  value estimates because shallow ground water levels in central portions of the basin are controlled, in part, by elevations of surface water channels. Decreased or increased recharge resulted in changes in the rates of water discharging to model drain, general head boundary (Lake Lowell), constant head (Snake River), and river (Boise River) cells. Changes in land  use that lead to decreases in shallow-aquifer recharge may not have a substantial effect on shallow ground water levels until the water table elevations remain below those of nearby  surface channels.  Simulations indicated that some ground water level declines might occur with a 20% increase in ground water withdrawals over 1996 levels. Modest simulated declines were observed in the Boise area in layers 1 and 2. Greater simulated declines were observed in the central portion of the valley (especially in the Lake Lowell area) in layers 3 and 4. The simulated  20% increase in ground water withdrawals resulted in increased losses from the Boise River (23%), decreased discharge to agricultural drains (62%), and decreased discharge to the Snake River (9%). Simulated water level declines andlor changes in mass balance  components reflected a combination of parameter uncertainty and response to a changed hydraulic stress.",Boise Basin,Research Report,,"IWRRI; Idaho Department of Water Resources; Urban, Scott; Doherty, John",Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,200402,200402,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2011-03-03,"300 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF; 18,471,856 bytes",Jodi Haire,,79
Simulation of increased ground water withdrawals in the lower Boise River basin,"Petrich, Christian R.",2004-02,Boise River,"43.65, -116.44",groundwater flow; Boise River watershed; computer simulation; Ada County; Canyon County,"Currently there are over 450 unprocessed applications for new water rights in the lower Boise  River basin, an area of southwestern Idaho that is home to approximately 35% of Idaho's  population. The additional water is being requested for irrigation, municipal, commercial,  and aesthetic uses. The water requested for non-supplemental purposes could represent  approximately a 20% increase over 1996 levels of ground water withdrawals. The potential  impact of processing these new well applications on regional ground water levels was  evaluated using the Treasure Valley ground water flow model (Petrich, 2004a).  The Treasure Valley ground water flow model was constructed with the USGS MODFLOW  code (McDonald and Harbaugh, 1996) and calibrated to steady-state hydraulic conditions  using the PEST parameter estimation code (Doherty, 2000). The calibration was based on  over 200 water level and 6 vertical head difference observations. Predictive analysis  (Doherty, 2000) was used to estimate worst (and best) potential outcomes given parameter  non-uniqueness in the calibrated model.  The simulation results indicated that aquifer level declines might occur if all of these  currently unprocessed, non-supplemental, ground water rights were granted. Water level  declines could be in the range of 10 feet to over 40 feet, depending on valley location, actual  amount of withdrawals, and depth of extraction. Local areas of simulated declines were  noted south of Lake Lowell in an area in the northwestern portion of the model and in  portions of an area between Boise, Meridian, and Kuna. These may be associated with  unrealistically high simulated stresses or excessively low simulated aquifer parameter values.  The simulated declines also may indicate potential problems in supplying the increasing  ground water demands in these areas.  The least declines were predicted in the uppermost model layer, which corresponds roughly  with the uppermost 200 feet of aquifer. Most of the estimated new simulated withdrawals in  the uppermost layer resulted in decreased discharge to drains.  The simulated declines presented in this report are the result of both calibration effects and  increased withdrawals. Additional comparisons between minimum base calibration heads  and prediction heads should be conducted to refine these predicted declines.",Boise Basin,Research Report,,"IWRRI; Idaho Department of Water Resources; Urban, Scott; Doherty, John",Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,200403,200403,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2004-03-09,"Acrobat PDFMaker 5.0 for Word, Acrobat 5.0.5 Distiller (Windows),Archival Master file is a TIFF; 4,421,050 bytes",Jodi Haire,,80

The University of Idaho Water Resources Research  Institute in turn entered into subcontracts with the water resources research  institutes of Oregon, Washington and Montana to do portions of the study involving  their respective states.  The purpose of the study was to evaluate the theoretical potential for  small hydroelectric development of the Pacific Northwest Region.  The study area included all of the Columbia River system in the United   States and all other river basins in Idaho, Oregon and Washington. The   total area studied is approximately 292,000 squares miles.  The first phase of the study was to evaluate the theoretical power potential   of the streams in the region. This portion of the study was completed   in March 1979.   This report is the completion report for Phase II of the study where an  evaluation of the hydro potential was made for existing dams without present   generating capabilities, proposed hydro sites, and at proposed power sites in   existing irrigation systems.  For this phase of the study small hydro was defined as a site with potential  to produce power between 200 kW and 25MW with flows at the 50%   exceedance level. This is slightly different than the Phase I definition   of low head hydro which called for power at the 50% exceedance to be greater   than 200 KW and heads to be between 3 and 20 meters. The change in definition  of Small Hydro sites was requested by the Department of Energy.   The existing dams that were studied were those that were identified in   state dam registration lists or in the Corps of Engineers Dam Safety Studies. The primary sources of information for the proposed sites were siting studies   done by various federal and state agencies. No searches were made for new   sites that had not been previously identified.   Another aspect to this study involved evaluating transmission and load   restraints at existing dams that do not have generating capabilities.

Mining operations in the past have discharged huge amounts of mining wastes into the South Fork of the river causing a serious pollution problem for the Coeur d'Alene River system. Sediments in the South Fork and the Main Stem of the river are contaminated with arsenic(As), antimony(Sb), cadmium(Cd), Lead(Pb), Zinc(Zn), and other metals. The North Fork water was found relatively uncontaminated and showed very low concentrations of As ( &lt;0.26 ng/mL) and Sb ( &lt;0.17 ng/mL). Water samples collected from the South Fork showed high levels of As (0.16-1.64 ng/mL) and Sb (1.11-8.25 ng/mL). Relatively lower concentrations of As (0.11-1.48 ng/mL) and Sb (0.23-1.90 ng/mL) were found in the main stem of the river. Arsenic(lll) was the predominant form of As in the South Fork and main stem, whereas the North Fork generally had a higher As(V) concentration in water. Antimony(V) was the major Sb species in the three branches of the river. Leaching of As and Sb from the sediments along the main stem depends on the pH of the water and on the iron and manganese content of the sediments. The amount of As and Sb leached was high in acidic or in basic solutions. The enhanced desorption of As and Sb in basic solutions was probably related to the anionic properties of these elements. An accumulation of As and Sb on the surface sediments was also observed in the delta area where the river enters Lake Coeur d'Alene. The releases of As and Sb from the sediments appear to associate with the free iron oxides and manganese oxides in the sediments. The leaching characteristics of Sb are similar to those of As. However, releases of sediment Sb were generally found linear with respect to time while asymptotic limits on As releases were reached. Significant amounts of Zn, Fe, and Mn were also released during leaching, but Cu, Cd, Ph, and Ni were much less leachable. According to this study, interaction of water with the existing sediments is likely to be a major factor controlling the water quality of the Coeur d'Alene River.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,198906,CDA_Wai_1989,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,89

These investigations were made in an attempt to answer questions as to the passage of metallic elements through the aquatic food chain in the study area as well as to determine the critical factors involved in the poor recovery of the South Fork and main stem of the Coeur d'Alene River. Additional work was carried out to determine the water quality of these areas and the Spokane River. Extensive studies were also made upon the substrata and limiting factors for macroinvertebrates of the Upper Spokane River. Artificial substrates (baskets) placed in the unpolluted portions of the Coeur d'Alene River developed abundant and diverse macroinvertebrate fauna comparable to that collected from natural substrata by Surber Sampler. Flooding of Coeur d'Alene River during the spring highwater period transports heavy metals, especially Zn, into the lateral lakes bordering the river. Zinc concentrations in the lake water were highest near the lake inlets. Metal concentrations in fishes from the lakes were higher than those tested from a control lake in the St. Joe drainage. There appeared to be greater Zn concentrations in the muscle tissues of omnivorous fish such as the bullhead than in the same tissue of piscivorous fish such as the large mouth bass. The fishes seem to be exerting some homeostatic control over the metal level in their tissues. The overall water quality of Coeur d'Alene Lake appeared to be relatively the same as the found in our earlier study (Funk, Rabe, and Filby et al., 1973) based upon routine water sampling during coring operations and on data gathered from a water quality station maintained at the lake outlet. Nineteen sediment cores were obtained along the lengthwise axis of the lake and from selected bays. A layer of heavy metals 80-30 cm in thickness occurred in the Coeur d'Alene delta region and lake proper. This layer decreased in thickness as one traversed the lake from off the delta region toward the outlet where the layer is reduced to 5 cm. Coring operations from the delta region of the lake toward the southern end revealed the same phenomenon occurred to a lesser extent to a point between the area of Conkling Park and Chatcolet Lake. This layer of heavy metals could constitute a hazard to aquatic life if Coeur d'Alene Lake eutrophies to the point of anaerobic conditions in the hypolimnion. The biological productivity of the Spokane River is largely controlled by the water quality of Coeur d'Alene Lake as well as by the substrate, temperature and flow of the river. Nutrient additions to the river as it flows toward the city of Spokane increases the productivity of the lower four stations, especially at the Plantes Ferry station. Heavy metals, such as Zn, Cu, and Pb, appear to be concentrated to relatively high amounts in algae, aquatic macrophytes and other vegetation growing along the river. Algae and detritus-consuming macroinvertebrates such as mayfiles and stoneflies pass these metals along to the fishes, expecially trout because of the trout's predilection for these organisms. However, there appears to be a reduction of concentration of metals in tissues at each trophic level as one moves up the food chain. The organisms appear to be actively excreting the metals. In the fishes, the filter bodies such as the kidneys and liver concentrated the metals several-fold over that of other tissues and therefore tend to confirm this assumption. Nonetheless, the level of Zn, for example, in the muscle tissue of Spokane River fishes may be two to three times that in muscle tissue of the same species taken from undisturbed streams high in Coeur d'Alene drainage. For these reasons it has been concluded by the investigators that additional efforts should be made to curtail and control seepage from tailings ponds as well as reduction and eventual control of wastes and nutrient runoff in the Coeur d'Alene and Spokane river drainage basins. The area encompassed by this study includes extremely valuable recreation, wildlife, and fisheries recources as well as sources of food and water for human consumption.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,197512,CDA_Funk_1975,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,90
"Blue-green algae toxicity in Black Lake, Kootenai County, Idaho. Research technical completion report","Kann, Jacob; Falter, Michael C.;",1985-09,Black Lake; Coeur d'Alene River,"47.45, -116.66",cyanophyta; phytoplankton; toxicity;,"Increasing occurrences of explosive growths or blooms of blue-green alqae in lakes throughout the western United States have been linked to recreational use, sewage inputs, and non-point runoff associated with agriculture and grazing. In certain instances these blooms produce a toxin which can be lethal to fish, aquatic invertebrates, mammals and humans. Black Lake in northern Idaho has experienced massive late summer and fall growths of a toxic algae, Nostoc commune. At times, demonstrated fatal toxicity to cattle and small mammals has resulted in three of the last four years. Since little is known of the exact environmental conditions required to cause toxicity, environmental and phytoplankton parameters were monitored throughout the lake durinq summer and fall, 1984. Although conditions seemed favorable, and other blooms were intermittent through the summer-fall 1984, Nostoc did not develop to bloom proportions and toxicity did not occur. Algal assay results showed that algal growth potential ranged in the very productive range of -1 9.60 to 12.16 mg dry weight 1 /14 days for the late summer-early fall period. The limiting nutrient switched from phosphorus to nitrogen during the fall months, also indicating the potential for a Nostoc bloom. All indicators showed that Black Lake was highly productive in 1984 despite the absence of a toxic Nostoc bloom. Water transparency ranqed from 0.8 to 3.4 m, averaging 1.2 m from June to October. pH values went as high as 8.2, with the total absence of CO2 in some of the littoral areas. Dissolved oxygen values were at super saturated levels throughout most of the sampling reqime. Diatoms (Fragilaria sp., Melosira sp., and Asterionella sp.) dominated the phytoplankton composition with Nostoc only showing up in early August. Chlorophyll 11 a11 values correlated with phytoplankton trends, with highs of 15 to 31 mgl-1, and lows of 0 to 5 mgl-1. The fact that Black Lake is clearly eutrophic, and that the potential for a blue-green bloom was present but did not materialize, may possibly be explained by two factors ... climatoloqical trends and stratification pattern. The absence of a well developed hypolimion along with excessive cloudiness and lack of a protacted calm, bright, and warm fall may have accounted for the lack of a toxic bloom in Black Lake during 1984.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,198508,CDA_Kann_1985,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,91
"Physical and chemical water quality of the Spokane River outlet reach of Lake Coeur d'Alene, Kootenai County, Idaho 1990 and 1991","Falter, C. Michael; Riggers, B.; Carlson, J. W.",1992-03,Spokane River; Coeur d'Alene Lake,"47.69, -116.81",water quality; flow; chemical composition; bacteria (coliform),"The University of Idaho conducted a water quality study on the Spokane River outlet arm of Lake Coeur d'Alene from June, 1990 through September, 1991. The project was sponsored by the Idaho Division of Environmental Quality (Coeur d'Alene office). Objectives of the study were to: 1) Characterize baseline river water quality; 2) determine seasonal river water quality variation; 3) assess diel temperature and dissolved oxygen changes for indications of aquatic ecosystem stress; and 4) provide a cursory view of the effects of existing and proposed wastewater discharges on river water quality, to the extent that river water quality data and WWTP data will allow. The study updated earlier work by the University of Idaho and USEPA in 1980 and 1988. The study area covered the 8.1-mile reach of the Spokane River from the outlet of Lake Coeur d'Alene at River Mile 108.8 downstream to just below Post Falls Dam at River Mile 100.7. This reach is typified by swift water currents and cobble bottom channel in the upper section merging to deeper, slower lacustrine conditions in the lower section where channel cobbles yield to fine sediments in lateral embayments. Water depths ranged from 2 to 18 m through the reach. Water flows in the 16-month study ranged from high flows of 31,750 cfs in May, 1990 to low flows of 340 cfs in September, 1990. Retention times of the study reach varied from 4.3 hours at annual high flows in 1990 and 1991, respectively, to 12.7 days at annual low flows in 1990 and 1991. Surface water temperatures peaked at 25.7 and 26.1 C in 1990 and 1991. Vertical thermal stratification was minimal, always less than 3.0 C from surface to bottom. Slight summer temperature increases were noted downstream through the reach. Sample site mean summer dissolved oxygen was always greater than 7.0 mg/1; one sample occurrence was recorded of 5.4 mg/1. Electrical conductivity generally ranged from 30 to 55 umhos. Median pH was slightly on the acid side (5.7 to 7.8) throughout the reach. Secchi depth ranged from 2.4 to 6.5 m with a study average of 4.0 m. High flows coincided with low secchi depths, as a result of suspended sediments and an extended spring algae pulse. Mean year-round chlorophyll a averaged 2.5 and 4.2 mg/m3 at the upper and lower sections of this river reach for an average 73% increase over the 7.6 mile reach. Mean summer chlorophyll a of the lower sections averaged 6.0 mg/m3 in 1990 but only 3.3 mg/m3 in 1991 (= 45% reduction) following 1) a very large spring algae bloom, and 2) 80% phosphorus removal from the Coeur d'Alene WWTP. The 1990 and 1991 chlorophyll a levels place the Spokane River in mesotrophic and meso-oligotrophic productivity ranges, rexi spectively. Mean Kjeldahl nitrogen was 0.18 mg/1 and generally increased &gt;20% below the Coeur d'Alene WWTP at low flows. There was a general trend of TKN increasing downstream through the study reach. The WWTPs contributed 25 to 50% of the TKN load to the Spokane River at low flows. Nitrate nitrogen was typically less than 0.05 mg/1 through summer months with fall-winter maxima of 0.50 mg/1. At low flows, WWTPs supplied 40% of the total nitrate load to the river. Mean total ammonia in the Spokane River arm of Lake Coeur d'Alene was 0.14 mg/1. From RM 111.1 to 108.8, there typically was an average 75% increase of total ammonia in the River, but less than one third of that increase was from the Coeur d'Alene WWTP. However, 30% of the average summer ammonia load to the river was from the Coeur d'Alene WWTP (up to 60% of the total ammonia load in September, 1991 at 340 cfs river flow). Total phosphorus ranged from 0.007 to 0.025 mg/1 with a study mean of 0.014 mg/1  (in the mesotrophic range). Total phosphorus increased 70% between RM 111.1 and 108.8over the entire study. Summer total phosphorus increased 87% between RM 111.1 and 108.8 over the entire study, 187% in 1991, but showed a 30% decline in 1991 after phosphorus removal in the Coeur d'Alene WWTP. WWTPs contributed -50% of the total phosphorus load to the reach at low flows. Upgrading the Coeur d'Alene WWTP in June, 1991 resulted in an effluent TP decline of 79%. Total N:total P ratios indicate phosphorus limitation most of the time with the exception of summer-fall 1990. BODs levels in the Spokane River were moderately high, averaging 3.4 mg/1 over all sites and dates. WWTP BODs levels from the Coeur d'Alene and Post Falls plants averaged 81.2 and 13.2 mg/1, respectively. Mean BODs increased 14% in the lower four river sites compared to the two upstream sites. Ultimate BOD in the Spokane River averaged 10.7 mg/1. WWTP ultimate BOD levels from the Coeur d'Alene and Post Falls plants averaged 644.7 and 371 mg/1, respectively. Mean ultimate BOD increased 11% in the lowest river site compared to the uppermost site. Median fecal coliform bacteria in the Spokane River were -1 colony/100 ml except for immediately below the WWTPs. Median fecal coliform bacteria were 30 and 24 colonies/100 ml in the Coeur d'Alene and Post Falls WWTPs, respectively. Median fecal coliform bacteria increased -30-fold from above to immediately below the Coeur d'Alene WWTP. River fecal coliform levels dropped to background concentrations within two river miles. Median fecal coliform bacteria increased -2-fold from above to immediately below the Post Falls WWTP.

"Potential for heavy metal migration from sediments of Lake Coeur d'Alene into the Rathdrum Prairie aquifer, Kootenai County, Idaho; Research technical completion report","Wyman, Susan A.",1993-11,Rathdrum Prairie; Kootenai,"47.79, -116.86",heavy metals; eutrophication; sediment,"The purpose of this project was to determine the potential for migration of heavy metals of Lake Coeur d'Alene into the Spokane Valley/Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer, as a result of changing lake chemistry caused by eutrophication. The upper sediment layers in Lake Coeur d'Alene are enriched in heavy metals and the lake appears to be becoming more eutrophic. The geologic history of the region contributes to the understanding of the hydrogeology of the study area.  The coarse-grained glacial outwash aquifer is bounded below by fine-grained sediments of the Latah formation, and bounded laterally by Precambrian sediments and metasediments. A conceptual model for surface water/groundwater interaction reveals that the cross sectional area of the aquifer increases from the northern end of Lake Coeur d'Alene farther into the aquifer. This could account for the steep hydraulic gradient from the lake to the aquifer. The steep gradient could also be a result of fine sediments which have infiltrated the glacial outwash and have decreased the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer, adjacent to the lake. Evidence for the infiltration of fine material exists in grain size analyses and unpublished reports. Lake Coeur d'Alene is dimictic and oligotrophic to eutrophic. Oxygen enrichment in the epilimnion and depletion in the hypolimnion are well-documented phenomena in eutrophic lakes. Dissolved oxygen concentrations as low as 52% were measured by the USGS northeast of Blue Point near Harrison in September, 1991. Anoxic, reducing conditions in the hypolimnion during summer stratification of the water column may cause Mn and Fe mobilization from sediments. Dissolved heavy metals in the hypolimnion are likely to coprecipitate with Mn oxyhydroxides (and to a lesser extent iron hydroxides) when the metals encounter more oxygenated water. Seismic profiles of the lake bottom indicate that fine, laminated sediments cover the central portions of the lake and thin out near the lake margins. These sediments contain elevated metals concentrations in both particulate form and in sediment pore water. The concentration gradient of metals in pore waters probably contributes to the upward migration of metals and the development of an enriched band of Fe, Mn and other trace metals in the sediment column. The band of Fe and Mn may reduce the concentration of trace metals in the water column (Sigg, 1987). The bulk of the water which moves from the lake into the aquifer during the summer """"low flow"""" period leaves Lake Coeur d'Alene as underflow. The area through which most water moves is probably within 300 feet (90 m) of the shore, where fine, laminated lake bottom sediments are lacking. This zone is probably well oxygenated for most of the year. Analyses from four monitoring wells at the surface water-groundwater interface reveal that metal concentrations are elevated in groundwater. Concentrations of Fe and Mn exceeded EPA SMCLs in all four wells. Three wells exceeded EPA MCLs for selenium. Well AIP-2 exceeded EPA MCLs for As, Cd and Ph. Clay samples from the well were highly enriched in As, Co and Cu, but only slightly above average background concentrations in Fe, Mn, Zn, U, and Th. The concentrations of Pb, Ni, Sr, V, and Cr in clays were slightly below average background concentrations. Metal migration into the aquifer does not appear to be attenuated by ionic adsorption onto clay materials. Eutrophication may have positive benefits for metal removal from the water column, as algae and Mn adsorb and precipitate trace metals. This benefit may be offset by the reducing conditions and elevated pH which result from aphotic biological activity in the hypolimnion.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI; University of Idaho Department of Geology and Geological Engineering,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,199303,CDA_Wyman_1993,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"Adobe Acrobat 10.1.3 Paper capture plug-in, 7,879,153 bytes; Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,95

Metal concentrations Md, Cd, Mg, Ca, Pb, Cu, Zn, Fe, Na and K; water quality and phytoplankton composition-density were determined for thirty-five dates during this period. Additional sampling included unpolluted portions of Coeur d'Alene Lake from December, 1969, to November, 1970, and the unaffected St. Joe River during the summers of 1969-70. Primary production ranged from 17.6 to 1337.9 mg C/m /day in the  Coeur d'Alene River and 69.3 to 1714.5 mg C/m2/day in the Coeur d'Alene Lake. Concentrations of zinc (0.1 to 11.2 mg Zn/1) and copper (0.0 to0.6 mg Cu/1) in the Coeur d'Alene River indicated that heavy metals could be toxic to algae. Diatoms dominated phytoplankton in the Coeur d'Alene River, Lake, and St. Joe River. Primary production in the southern portion of Coeur d'Alene Lake appeared controlled by discharges from the Coeur d'Alene and St. Joe rivers. Low concentrations of inorganic carbon and moderately high concentrations of nitrate and phosphate in the Coeur d'Alene River, Lake and St. Joe River suggest the importance of carbon in regulating production. The effect of wind on eplimnetic production and poorly developed stratification in the south end of the lake appeared related to decreased depths. Wind action may control eutrophication by suppressing hypolimnetic oxygen depletion and anaerobic regeneration. Nannoplankton from Coeur d'Alene Lake were exposed to known concentrations of Cu2+, Cd 2+, Zn 2+ and dilutions of Coeur d'Alene River water under controlled light and temperature. Inhibitory effects of separate and interacting metals on carbon-14 uptake by algae were assessed with factorial designed bioassays and response surfaces. Copper, cadmium, and zinc were acutely and synergistically toxic to carbon uptake by phytoplankton. Concentrations ranged from 0.05 to 0.75 mg Cu/1, 0.1 to 0.3 mg Cd/1, and 0.1 to 1.5 mg Zn/1. Copper caused an overriding effect on two- and three-way interactions of Cu 2+ , Cd 2+ , and Zn 2+ . Dilutions of Coeur d'Alene River water decreased Cu and Zn toxicity.

Water quality data show heavy inflows of nutrients during late spring into Coeur d'Alene Lake from the St. Joe and Coeur d'Alene Rivers and Plummer Creek.  Although no water devoid of dissolved oxygen have been measured, 2-4  mg/1 have been measured in the southern portion of the lake.  Phytoplankton productivity measurements and bottom organism identification and enumeration have shown that the lake functions at several trophic levels, meso-eutrophic to eutrophic in the southern portion, mesotrophic in the immediate area of the Coeur d'Alene River and ogliotrophic in the northern portions.  High metal concentrations (1000-7000 mg/kg Zn) in the bottom sediment of the middle and northern portions of the lake did not appear to substantially affect distribution of benthic chironomids or ogliochaetes.  Lake sediment cores taken across the delta region of the Coeur d'Alene River penetrated through the region of high metallic concentration and allowed an average sediment deposition rate to be calculated.  Algal toxicity tests showed the amount of Zn normally present in the Coeur d'Alene River and Spokane River to be inhibitory to the algal test organism Selanastrum capricornutum.  The water quality of the Spokane River was shown to be of good to excellent quality in all parameters tested except for high metallic content, especially Zn.  Activation and atomic absorption analysis of metallic content in the tissues of the organisms populating the Spokane River indicated that the algae were the prime concetrators of Zn, Cd, Pb, Hg, Fe, and Mn.  Algae and detritus consumers such as the larvae of caddisfly Hydropsyche and the nymphs of the mayfly Baetis reflected high metallic concentrations.  Most higher aquatic plants showed relatively lower concentrations.  Analysis of fish tissues showed considerably less concentration of metals than the aquatic plants, insects or algae.  However, Zn was measured at concentrations of 80-200 mg/kg in liver tissues of several species of fishes.  Fillet tissues generally contained less than one quarter of these amounts.  The fish, when collected, did not appear under stress leading the investigators to believe that most of the metals--although present in relatively high concentration in the tissues of the orgamisms tested--must be in a relatively innocuous state.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,"Co-investigators: Dunigan, Jr., Paul F.

"Investigation of the chemical composition and distribution of mining wastes in Killarney Lake, Coeur d'Alene Area, Northern Idaho","Bender, Scott F.",1991-10,Killarney Lake; Coeur d'Alene River,"47.52, -116.56",mine wastes; sediment; heavy metals;,"Killarney Lake, a lateral lake of the Coeur d'Alene River in northern Idaho, received mining and milling wastes from the Coeur d'Alene mining district for nearly 100 years. Mining and milling wastes were transported by the river during flood events until 1968 when tailings ponds were built. Lake bed sediments in Killarney Lake were sampled at three separate localities using a piston core sampler operated from a raft. The cores collected 3.6 m and 3.5 m of lake bottom sediments from the north and south ends of the lake, respectively, and 6.4 m of sediments from the center of the lake. Lake bed sediments were also sampled to a depth of 59 em using a freezer box sampler. A control core and freezer box section were extracted from Bells Lake in the nearby St. Joe River drainage, an area free of commercial mining practices. Identification of the Mazama ash, which was collected at 6.1 m below lake bottom in Killarney Lake and 3.8 m below lake bottom in Bells Lake, by microprobe analysis enabled the chronology of cores from both lakes to be constrained. The lake bottom sediments were sampled to. evaluate heavy metal concentrations downstream of the mining district. Sediments were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry for As, Ag, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn. Sediments from Bells Lake showed similar chemistry to the pre-mining sediments in Killarney Lake, suggesting that Bells Lake was an adequate control. High concentrations of heavy metals are present in the top 59 em of the Killarney Lake bed at the center and deepest portion of the lake. Up to 17.5 em of metallic silt were collected at the north and south ends of the lake. The highest observed metal concentrations in the sediment were 376 ppm As, 37 ppm Ag, 475 ppm Cu, 146 ppm Cd, 111,000 ppm Fe, 13,440 ppm Mn, 71 ppm Ni, 37,400 ppm Pb, and 32,850 ppm Zn. In this uppermost layer, concentrations of metals are 1 to 3 orders of magnitude greater than in deeper Killarney Lake sediments or in Bells Lake. A sharp, defined contact was observed between the natural organic silt and the introduced metallic silt. Organic silt was also observed overlying the metallic silt in the freezer box sample. Sediments with heavy metal concentrations above that of background were found to occur a maximum of 22.5 em below the lower metallic silt and organic silt contact.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,199101,CDA_Bender_1991,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,99
