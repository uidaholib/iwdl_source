# About {{ site.title }}

The Idaho Waters Digital Library (IWDL) provides open digital access to unique information resources relating to water issues in key Idaho river basins.
Making up the core of the collection are more than 700 documents produced by [Idaho Water Resources Research Institute](http://www.uidaho.edu/research/entities/iwrri) (IWRRI) researchers between 1980 and 2012, digitized by University of Idaho Library.

## Background

A significant amount of unique research publications related to Idaho water resources remain difficult to discover and access, existing in print copies only with limited availability to researchers and the public.
To address this issue, the IWDL has been developed and managed at the University of Idaho Library since 2008, when Jodi Haire laid the foundation as a graduate project.
Using the CONTENTdm digital asset management system, her work was influential in jump starting the Digital Initiatives program at the library, representing its first large document collection hosted online.
The IWDL was greatly enhanced and expanded by funding from the United States Geological Survey administered by IWRRI in 2012 and 2017, enabling library staff to build out the collection as it is today.
More than 700 documents are currently accessible, ranging in date from 1897 to 2016 and representing over 550 critical subject areas, such as mine wastes, water policy, hydroelectric power, and aquifer management. 
IWDL serves as a central repository to facilitate research on Idaho watersheds, enabling better discovery, access, and dissemination, while ensuring digital preservation of the materials. 
The value of this resource was recognized by selection for inclusion in the [Western Waters Digital Library](http://westernwaters.org/), which aggregates “digital collections of significant primary and secondary resources on water in the Western United States”. 

the value of the repository as an aggregated resource, bringing vital content to researchers and other users.


public web interface incorporating principles of responsive design, accessibility, and search engine optimization that will ensure quality usability and discovery. 
Better use of metadata and structured markup will increase the findability of resources in the collection, connecting with more researchers.
Database maintenance and an archival storage workflow will be developed to ensure long term preservation of digital assets. 
 
It will provide access to a wealth of content and technical enhancements that add value for researchers, scholars, and other stakeholders. 
IWDL will support ongoing research and understanding of our region while preserving an era of previous work and research investment. 
The enhancements provided by phase two of IWDL development will solidify the value and importance of the collection, while ensuring quality user experience, discoverability, and stewardship for the long term.

As in phase one of the IWDL project, digitization activities will be complimented by development in the public facing web interface and preservation back end. The IWDL web site requires a refresh to keep up with contemporary usage patterns. With more people accessing our collections via diverse devices, it is necessary to rethink the web design, refactoring to a fully responsive template that functions equally well on a smart phone or desktop. This redesign will incorporate the latest web standards to ensure accessibility and maximize search engine optimization. Likewise, the digital preservation landscape has changed significantly since 2011, and we endeavor to follow the most up-to-date best practices to steward our resources. Phase two will carry out database maintenance and preparation to secure all IWDL content in our archival storage. We will enact further measures to safe guard the digital objects and metadata, ensuring continued access for future generations.

Phase two of the IWDL project opens access to regional water resource documents related to key Idaho river basins that are currently difficult to obtain. Improvements to the web infrastructure increases the visibility and value of existing research outputs, while facilitating current research activities. Updating the repository and digital archive safeguards information and research investment. This phase of IWDL development will secure better access, discoverability, and preservation of unique water resource research for scholars and other stakeholders in the region.

The project seeks to increase the value and importance of the IWDL by aggregating the remaining IWRRI materials and improving user experience and discoverability. This will solidify the IWDL as a vital resource for researchers and scholars, supporting ongoing research and understanding of critical challenges in our region. Work on metadata and digital preservation will ensure continued long term access to the unique materials.

The IWDL and two other UI Library digital collections are included in the Western Waters Digital Library (WWDL http://westernwaters.org/). WWDL aggregates unique materials related to water resources in the Western US improving and simplifying discovery for a diverse group of stakeholders. However, it does not build collections or digitize materials. WWDL and other aggregators rely on quality regional collections, such as IWDL, New Mexico Waters (http://econtent.unm.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/NMWaters), or California Water Documents (http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/cwd), to provide the content necessary for researchers.
