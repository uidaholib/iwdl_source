# About {{ site.title }}

The Idaho Waters Digital Library provides access to information resources relating to water issues in key Idaho river basins. The collection presently includes scientific and technical reports, with an emphasis on [Idaho Water Resources Research Institute](http://www.uidaho.edu/research/entities/iwrri) reports and publications. Documents can be browsed by Location, Date, and Subject Term by using the tabs above. The database can also be queried extensively using the Table feature.

This project would not have been possible without the grant support of the United States Geological Survey, the administrative support of the Idaho Water Resources Research Institute, the metadata & digitization work of Warren Bromley-Vogel, and the conceptual efforts of Jodi Haire.

The full metadata can be downloaded here [IWDL Export]({{ "/export/iwdl-data.csv" | absolute_url }}).
